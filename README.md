==========

My own implementation of [Prismata](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lunarchstudios/prismata-a-new-hybrid-game-of-pure-strategy) connection animation

[Reddit thread about it](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2on8si/connecting_to_server_so_mesmerizing/)

**Note:** This is my own reimplementation from scratch of the animation using Python and Kivy, and is in no way based on the code posted by [/u/Elyot](http://www.reddit.com/user/Elyot) on [the comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2on8si/connecting_to_server_so_mesmerizing/cmow0sz)
